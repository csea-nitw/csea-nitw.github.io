# What is a Portfolio Website?
Github provides its user free hosting services to host a static site. But a user can host only one site using the Github's hosting services. The repository having the same name as that of the username will be automatically hosted by Github. The site would be named as username.github.io, for eg this repository is hosted as csea-nitw.github.io .
